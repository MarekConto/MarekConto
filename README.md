# Hey there! 👋 I'm Marek Conto

🔐 Cybersecurity student by day, fighting semicolons by night. Endurance sports and adventure are my kind of downtime.

☕ My code runs on caffeine... If it compiles, it's thanks to the coffee. 

🚴‍♂️ When you're not able to reach me, I'm probably doing something stupid - either climbing a mountain 🧗‍♀️ or speeding through the streets on 25mm thick wheels.

💡 I've got a thing for breaking things - whether it's breaking my personal records on the bike or breaking software :D 


## Currently Breaking:

- 📚 Learning everything that crosses my path. Forever curious, forever learning.
- The right blend of 🐍 Python, 🛢️SQL,  🅒 C, ☁️ Linux, and other technologies served with a side of caffeine. ☕️
